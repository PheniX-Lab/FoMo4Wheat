# Abstract
Vision-driven in-field crop monitoring is essential for advancing digital agriculture whether supporting commercial decisions on-farm or augmenting research experiments in breeding and agronomy. Existing crop vision models struggle to generalize across fine-scale, highly variable canopy structures, and fluctuating outdoor environments. In this work, we present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first crop-orientated vision foundation models and demonstrate that delivers strong performance across a wide range of agricultural vision tasks. Centered on wheat, the most globally significant food crop, we curated ImAg4Wheatâ€”the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date. It comprises 2.5 million high-resolution images collected over a decade from breeding and experimental fields, spanning more than 2,000 genotypes and 500 distinct environmental conditions across 30 global sites. A suite of FoMo4Wheat models was pre-trained using self-supervised learning on this dataset. Benchmark results across ten crop-related downstream tasks show that FoMo4Wheat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models trained on general-domain datasets. Beyond strong cross-task generalization within wheat crops, FoMo4Wheat is highly robust in limited-data regimes but on previously unseen crop data. Notably, it contributes significantly to vision tasks in rice and multiplw crop/weed images, highlighting its cross-crop adaptability. In delivering one of the first open-source foundation models for wheat, our results demonstrate the value of such crop-specific foundation models that will support the development of versatile high-performing vision systems in crop breeding and precision agriculture.â€ƒ
